.SH DESKTOP MANAGEMENT
The PCMan File Manager can manage your desktop. That includes drawing some
background on it and showing icons of Desktop folder. To activate the desktop
management the \fBpcmanfm\fP should be executed with option \fB\-\-desktop\fP.
Other option that affects this mode is \fB\-\-one\-screen\fP. Change running
desktop manager parameters you can by executing \fBpcmanfm\fP with option
\fB\-\-desktop\-pref\fP which opens window with preferences or using command
line parameters for options \fB\-\-set\-wallpaper\fP or \fB\-\-wallpaper\-mode\fP.
Execution \fBpcmanfm \-\-desktop\-off\fP terminates desktop management.

While \fBpcmanfm\fP manages desktop it displays icons on desktop. Behavior
of icons resembles folder view in main window of \fBpcmanfm\fP but icons on
desktop can "remember" their position. If you have two or more monitors then
desktop background and set of icons will be shown on each of them. Icons
positions will be remembered individually for each of monitors.
